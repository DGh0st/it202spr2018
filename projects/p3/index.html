        <h1>Project 3 - Deep Patel</h1>
        <p>Link to my GitHub home page: <a href="http://dgh0st.github.io/">http://dgh0st.github.io/</a></p>
        <p>This home page link has existed prior to this course. It isn't a bootstrap 4 page, but the iOS Runtime Modifications are dynamically loaded based on the array in js\tweak.js by cloning a template div and filling it with information. Each of these modifications (small projects) have a name, description, image, download links, source code, etc.</p>
